    "memo": "People are scared to ask real questions online. What if we could get honest answers from real people without anyone knowing who's asking? Like a therapist explaining what anxiety actually feels like, or a firefighter talking about their first call. Social media rewards performance, not honesty. People post what gets likes, not what they actually think. When you ask something real, you either get trolled or ignored. I want to build something where the quality of the answer matters more than who's giving it. You could ask 'What does depression actually feel like?' and get real answers from people who've been there, not just generic advice. The key is making it anonymous so people feel safe to be vulnerable, but also making sure the answers are actually helpful.",

    "status": "Rough idea",

    "memo": "What if we had a messenger where conversations don't stick around forever? I keep thinking about all the times I've sent a message and immediately regretted it, or had a conversation that I wish would just disappear. Most messaging apps are built around permanence - everything gets saved, backed up, synced across devices. But what if we built something around the opposite? All chats disappear after 24 hours unless you want them to stay. The idea is to make messaging feel more like real conversation - temporary, in the moment, without the pressure of creating a permanent record. Teens are constantly worried about their digital footprint, or people in early relationships who want to be vulnerable without creating evidence that could come back to haunt them. The key is making it feel safe and intentional, not like you're trying to hide something bad.",

    "memo": "People struggle to manage their communities online. Whether it's a study group that keeps getting derailed by off-topic posts, or a professional community where people are afraid to ask real questions, or a hobby club where the conversation just dies because there's no structure. What if we had a platform where organizers could control exactly how their groups work? Like setting rules about what people can share, when conversations expire, and who can join. Most community platforms are either too rigid (like corporate Slack) or too chaotic (like Facebook groups). I want to build something in between - flexible enough to work for different types of communities, but structured enough to actually help people have better conversations. Think about a study group where only the teacher can post assignments, or a support group where conversations automatically expire after a week to protect privacy. The key is giving organizers the tools they need without making it complicated for regular members.",
