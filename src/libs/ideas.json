    "memo": "A wishlist that actually feels personal and useful. The goal is better gifts and feeling seen—not another shopping list. Onboarding asks what makes you feel loved. Items carry the 'why' behind them. Group gifts feel like people showing up, not just pooling cash. Support gifts are time and care—meals, babysitting, a note that lands. Quiet animations, soft sounds, and warm copy keep it gentle. Success here is smiles, small moments, and connection—not clicks.",
