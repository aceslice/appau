    <p class="text-gray-700 md:w-3/4" style="line-height: 2">
      We built Larry SMS Hub as a mobile app because we saw everyday businesses struggling with communication. One of the reasons—not the only reason—was that many SMS tools out there are built for developers with clunky, hard-to-read interfaces that regular users don't enjoy.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700 md:w-3/4 mt-3" style="line-height: 2">
      Larry SMS Hub fixes that with a clean, friendly mobile experience. Set up your messages once, schedule them, and let it run. Feel confident hitting send—your customers see your branded business name, not a random number.

      <h3 class="font-semibold mb-3">How it works</h3>
      <div class="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-700">
        <p><strong>Install and sign in:</strong> Open the app, add your business details, and you're ready.</p>
        <p><strong>Set up your sender ID:</strong> Messages come from your business name (like "YOURSHOP"), not a random number—so people recognize you instantly.</p>
        <p><strong>Create groups:</strong> Organize contacts—parents, VIP customers, departments.</p>
        <p><strong>Write and schedule:</strong> Use templates or write your own. Send now or schedule for later without stress.</p>
        <p><strong>Send and track:</strong> Deliver on time and see delivery status—all from your phone, so you never wonder if it went through.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mb-3">Who uses this</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        Schools sending fee reminders. Churches announcing events. Small shops running promotions. Clinics sending appointment reminders.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Basically, any business that needs to talk to their customers regularly but doesn't want to do it manually every time.

      <h3 class="font-semibold mb-3">What I learned building this</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        People ignore messages from random numbers. But when they see their school's name or their favorite shop's name, they actually read it—and feel seen. It's that simple.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        The hardest part wasn't the tech—it was proving that simple, well-designed mobile flows make automation feel more personal, not less. When the mechanics disappear, the message shines and relationships grow.
      </p>

    <section class="mt-6">
      <h3 class="font-semibold mb-3">Pay as you go</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        No monthly fees, no contracts. Just pay for what you use. Top up with as little as 2 cedis and start sending—no surprises.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        The more you send, the better the rate. Simple, transparent pricing that grows with your business, so you can plan with confidence.
