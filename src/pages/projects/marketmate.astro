      I'm building this because I got tired of the same old grocery shopping. You know how it is - you go to the market, buy too much, half of it goes bad, and you're back next week doing the same thing.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700 md:w-3/4 mt-3" style="line-height: 2">
      MarketMate is simple: fresh food, every week, without the stress. We work with local farmers to plan what's in season, you get a box that actually makes sense for your kitchen.
    </p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mb-3">How it works</h3>
      <div class="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-700">
        <p><strong>Pick your box:</strong> Small, Standard, or Family. Whatever fits your household.</p>
        <p><strong>See what's coming:</strong> Every week you get a preview of your box with simple recipe ideas.</p>
        <p><strong>Swap if you want:</strong> Don't like something? Swap it for something else. We keep it simple - just 1 or 2 swaps per week.</p>
        <p><strong>Add extras:</strong> Need eggs, bread, or honey? Add them to your weekly order.</p>
        <p><strong>Pick up:</strong> Show your QR code at your nearest hub. Takes 30 seconds.</p>
      </div>
      
      
      <div class="mt-4 p-3 rounded-lg bg-green-50 border border-green-200">
        <p class="text-sm text-green-800">
          <strong>Why I'm building this:</strong> I want to support local farmers and make fresh food accessible. Every box comes with a note about where your food was grown and who grew it. No more mystery produce from who-knows-where.
        </p>

    <section class="mt-6">
      <h3 class="font-semibold mb-3">The problem I'm solving</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        Grocery shopping is broken. You waste time, buy too much, half of it goes bad, and you're back next week doing the same thing. Farmers struggle to plan what to grow because they don't know what people actually want.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        MarketMate fixes both sides: you get fresh, seasonal food without the stress, and farmers get predictable orders so they can grow what people actually eat.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-6">
      <h3 class="font-semibold mb-3">Who this is for</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        Busy families who want fresh food without the hassle. Small restaurants that need reliable produce. Anyone who's tired of the same old grocery routine.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        We're not trying to be everything to everyone. Just a simple way to get fresh, local food every week.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-6">
      <h3 class="font-semibold mb-3">The challenge</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        Building this isn't easy. I need to convince farmers to grow what people actually want, not just what's easy to grow. I need to find the right pickup spots that work for everyone. I need to make the app simple enough that your grandmother can use it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        But I think it's worth it. Fresh food shouldn't be a luxury, and farmers shouldn't have to guess what to plant.

          <div>
            <div class="font-semibold">Is MarketMate a mobile app?</div>
            <p>Yes. Download the app, subscribe to a box, manage swaps, and show your QR code at pickup.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class="font-semibold">How do swaps work?</div>
            <p>You get 1–2 swap credits per week. Don’t want okra? Swap for a suggested alternative (like green beans). Swaps close a few days before pickup so farmers can harvest on time.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class="font-semibold">What if I’m traveling?</div>
            <p>Pause or skip in the app anytime. No penalties.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class="font-semibold">Can I get delivery?</div>
            <p>We’re pickup‑first to keep food fresh and costs low. Hubs are nearby and fast. Delivery may come later for special cases.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class="font-semibold">How do farmers use it?</div>
            <p>Farmers don’t need smartphones. They get simple USSD/SMS orders each week to confirm quantities and get paid on time.</p>
